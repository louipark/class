		// are to opening the lock.
		// Using this single bit of information, your job
		// is to find the integer value that opens the lock
		
		// This method is only for honors students and the curious to complete
		// Honor students: Be prepared to demonstrate how you completed
		// this problem!

		// This method is not tested as part of the MP
		
		// Beginner: This problem is not for beginners
		
		// Intermediate: It took me 90 minutes to create a robust solution 
		// (including 15 minutes debugging it with several million tests).
		
		// Advanced: 'Don't be wasteful' -
		// Assume there is a 1s time penalty for every unlocking attempt,
		// make sure your code uses the fewest number of unlocking attempts
		// ie. It will open the lock as quickly as possible.
		// (My solution was little wasteful but was simpler to implement).
