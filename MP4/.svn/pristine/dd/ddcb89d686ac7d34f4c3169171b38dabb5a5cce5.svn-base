Instruction
============
List at least 1 code smell for each question.
List at least 1 code example for each code smell.
Explain the code smell in each example with 1 or 2 sentences. 
(e.g. the process of ... appears 2 times in ... method.)

Answer to Q1
============
We found the following code smell(s): Duplicated code

Here are some example(s) of each code smell: 

Name: Duplicated code

Example 1: The logging code occurs 3 times, 2 times inside Network.requestWorkStationPrintsDocument and 1 time inside Network.requestBroadCast
Code: 
	report.write("\tNode '");
	report.write(startNode.name);
	report.write("' passes packet on.\n");
	report.flush();

-> Code is extracted to be named as method packetMovementLogger(Writer report, Node startNode) which writes/logs packet movement.

Example 2: The logging code for the beginning of report object occurs 2 times inside Network.printDocument.
Code: 
	report.write("\tAccounting -- author = '");
	report.write(author);
	report.write("' -- title = '");
	report.write(title);
	report.write("'\n");

-> Code is extracted to be named as method printDocumentHeaderLogger(Writer report, String author, String title),
which writes/logs the header of every document to be printed.


Answer to Q2
============
We found the following code smell(s): Feature Envy

Here are some example(s) of each code smell:

Name: Feature Envy

Example 1: The method packetMovementLogger(Writer report, Network network) is accessed by a Node object and accesses Node class attributes rather than Network class.

Code: 
	public void packetMovementLogger(Writer report, Network network)
			throws IOException {
		report.write("\tNode '");
		report.write(name);
		report.write("' passes packet on.\n");
		report.flush();
	}

-> Code is moved to Node class and visibility is changed to public as method is never used locally.

Example 2: The method printDocumentHeaderLogger(Writer report, String author, String title) is accessed by the Node object printer and accesses Node class 
attributes rather than Network class.
Code: 
	public void printDocumentHeaderLogger(Writer report, String author, String title) throws IOException {
		report.write("\tAccounting -- author = '");
		report.write(author);
		report.write("' -- title = '");
		report.write(title);
		report.write("'\n");
	}

-> Code is moved to Node class and visibility is changed to public as method is never used locally.

Answer to Q3
============
We found the following code smell(s): <CODE_SMELL_NAME_1>, <CODE_SMELL_NAME_2>...

Here are some example(s) of each code smell: 

Name: <CODE_SMELL_NAME_1>

Example 1: <EXPLANATION_FOR_EXAMPLE_1>
Code: 
	<CODE_OF_EXAMPLE_1>

Example 2: <EXPLANATION_FOR_EXAMPLE_2>
Code: 
	<CODE_OF_EXAMPLE_2>
